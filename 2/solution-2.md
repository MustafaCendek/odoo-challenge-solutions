## If you are using Google Chrome, you can view the page source by Ctrl+Shift+I or F12 key.  
## When we examine the source code from the reveal tab, there are a scripts named challenge.css in the header.

## Here we found the hidden message.  
![Secret Message](./img/test2-02.png)  
## When we run the atob function in the console with the argument written in the message, it gives us the password,  
![Test 2 Password](./img/test2-03.png)
